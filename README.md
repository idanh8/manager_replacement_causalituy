# manager_replacement_causality
Our final project for the Causal Inference Course, performing a causal assessment of whether replacing a football manager improves a team's results
This is a working directory, containing the code and data files. A full ReadMe with explanations, a how to run guide and the results will hopefully be uploaded soon. 
Teaser - there isn't much of a causal link between replacing a manager and performance improvements. Sorry ðŸ¥²
